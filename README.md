# Pulsar Stars Classification in Semi-Supervised Learning

The goal of this project is to explore and compare the
performances of the Gradient Descent method and the
Block Coordinate Gradient Descent methods with randomized
and cyclic rules, in Semi-Supervised Learning.

For this purpose, we will first consider a convex function
minimization problem with respect to randomly
generated points in the 2D space. 

Secondly, we will
approach the same problem on a real-world dataset, namely the [HTRU2 dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2) containing a sample
of Pulsar candidates, labeled as Pulsar or Non-Pulsar
stars. Each Pulsar candidate is described by some
continuous statistic measures (mean, standard deviation,
kurtosis and skewness) of the integrated profile
and the DM-SRN Curve, for a total of eight features.

In particular, the classification task is carried out by
examining the feature similarities of the data (see `report/essay.pdf` for more details).
